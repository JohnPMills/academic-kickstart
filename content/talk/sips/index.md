# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "Whilst there has been a great deal of attention focused within the anti-doping literature on moral processes, existing evidence has been heavily influenced by Kohlberg’s Moral Development Theory. Unlike moral pluralists such as James (1909/1987), Kohlberg (1971, p. 232) argued that “Virtue is ultimately one, not many [processes], and it is always the same ideal form regardless of climate or culture”. This absolutist view of morality argues that certain acts are inherently right or wrong. However, such a position has been heavily criticised for failing to account for cultural differences (Gilligan 1982, Greene & Haidt, 2002). This project proposes to examine the moral mechanisms that underpin doping intentions across cultures so that a bespoke value-based anti-doping training programmes may be developed."
