My training lies at the intersection between Social and Developmental Psychology and my research focuses on two themes. My funded research experience has focused on two themes: Sporting Integrity, and Psychosocial Competency Development. Within the Sport Integrity theme, I focus on
leadership, coaching, and mentoring; morality and character development; and coach
and athlete welfare. Within the psychosocial competency theme, my interests focus on
the development of personal and social skills within both neurotypical and neurodiverse
populations. 

My research goals are to (1) further enhance my international reputation, (2)
build upon my existing network of world-leading researchers and continue to develop
new opportunities for collaboration, (3) develop new insights,
tackle international challenges, and create new collaborations and mentoring
opportunities within my lab, and (4) further engage with my scientific communication
efforts and create meaningful outcomes that positively impact the communities I serve. To
successfully achieve these goals, I collaborate within and across disciplines (e.g.,
psychology, philosophy, education, and public health).

At work, I am the Director of <a href="https://teamresearchlab.org">Team Researcher Lab </a> which typically houses around 10-15 students. I also lead the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences/research/development-of-young-people-through-sport">Developing Young People through Sport Research Group</a> within the School of Sport, Rehabilitation, and Exercise Sciences at the University of Essex. I founded <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/sportrxiv">SportRÏ‡iv</a> in 2016, and more recently <a href="https://www.storkinesiology.org">the Society for Transparency, Openness, and Replication in Kinesiology</a> (STORK) in 2019. I enjoy creating tools, solving problems, and bringing people together around a vision or project. I know this sounds corny but it's true. Outside of work, I run an education focused <a href="https://awfullygood.org">not-for-profit</a>. Our mission is to support young people to develop the skills they need to thrive in the 21st century and live awfully good lives. I also host a podcast (it's 2022, who doesn't) called <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sports-debate-a-fortnightly-podcast-where-academic/id1569350911">Sports Debate</a> and in 2019 I wrote a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1916204503/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_4EEXGH5SEM5HZKR0KJGZ">First Time Sports Coach.</a>

I'm also married and have two young sons, who keep me pretty busy. On the rare occasion I get an afternoon to myself, I love watching football and try to see my beloved West Ham United as much as I can. Before entering academia, I spent 10 years working as an academy and community football coach both within the UK and US. If you'd like to discuss anything further, I'm open to grabbing a cup of tea and chatting more -- virtual or otherwise.
