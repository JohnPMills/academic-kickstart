My training lies at the intersection between Social and Developmental Psychology and my research focuses on the integrity of sport. In practice this means examining topics such as moral leadership, anti-doping, and athlete welfare. This includes research on values, virtues, norms, practices, identities, and the psychosocial mechanisms that combine to regulate behaviour. My published research -- which is all available to download here -- generally falls within these topics but I'm a curious person and occasionally you'll find something left field that I was just interested in. 

At work, I am the Director of <a href="https://teamresearchlab.org">Team Researcher Lab </a> which currently houses 15 students (inc. ten postgrads). I also lead the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/sport-rehabilitation-and-exercise-sciences/research/development-of-young-people-through-sport">Developing Young People through Sport Research Group</a> within the School of Sport, Rehabilitation, and Exercise Sciences at the University of Essex. In terms of service, I founded <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/sportrxiv">SportRÏ‡iv</a> in 2016, and more recently (<a href="https://www.storkinesiology.org">the Society for Transparency, Openness, and Replication in Kinesiology (STORK)</a>) in 2019. I enjoy creating tools, solving problems, and bringing people together around a vision or project. I know this sounds corny but it's true. Outside of work, I run an education focused <a href="https://awfullygood.org">not-for-profit</a>. I'm also married and have two boys under 5, which keep me pretty busy. On the rare occasion I get an afternoon to myself, I love watching football and in a previous life worked as an academy and community coach. 


If you'd like to discuss anything further, I'm open to grabbing a cup of tea and chatting more -- virtual or otherwise.
