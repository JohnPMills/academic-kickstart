"For the past 24-years, I have been attempting to make the complex simple and to support the development of young people. I am easily bored and am always looking for new challenges to keep life interesting. I consider myself a problem solver and some of the solutions I have found include: Creating the First Open Access Subject Repository for Sport, Exercise and Health related research called <a href=\"https://www.sportrxiv.org/\">SportRxiv</a>, and bringing together a group of scientists from around the world to form the <a href=\"https://www.tos-kin.org/\">Society for Transparency, Openness, and Reproducibilty in Kinesiology</a> and build out from SportRxiv. Some other problems I am currently working on include changing the academic culture around research integrity through open science at <a href=\"https://www.eur.nl/en\">Erasmus University Rotterdam</a>, and figuring out how best to support online gamers with their mental health at <a href=\"https://www.play-aid.org/\">Play Aid</a>. If you have a problem that you think I can help with, <a href=\"mailto:your-email@example.com\">drop me an email</a>.
