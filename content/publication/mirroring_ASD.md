abstract = "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterised as a neurodevelopmental disorder that has continuing deficits in communication skills and social development. Utilising techniques known as mirroring and rhythm, Dance and Movement Therapy (DMT) has shown beneficial effects in the autistic population reducing such deficits. However, no review to date has investigated these individual techniques outside the practice of DMT. This systematic review of studies published between 1975 and 2020 aims to evaluate the effectiveness of both mirroring and rhythm as interventions that target communication skills and social development in children diagnosed with ASD. Out of 1369 relevant articles, 11 met the inclusion criteria. All studies showed beneficial effects of mirroring and rhythm for communication skills and social development in children diagnosed with ASD. Therefore, incorporating these techniques into new interventions and practice may offer substantial therapeutic benefits for autistic children."
