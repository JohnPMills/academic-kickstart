In doing so, the study provides a first person account to showcase the realities of refereeing whereby adding to a small pool of refereeing literature in the process. In providing an evocative account with a theoretical analysis, the research aims to 1) improve knowledge surrounding the current high drop-out rates within youth football referees by showcasing, and explaining the challenges associated with the position 2) inform and subsequently aid aspiring officials in their ongoing development and finally 3) encourage other referees to speak up to voice their concerns within the profession. By constructing the said narratives in an easy-to-understand manner, the study looks to showcases the challenges associated with officiating to a broad audience."
