abstract = "Within the present manuscript, I outline transformational leadership as a concept, identify gaps in our current empirical understanding of the concept, clarify a host of conceptual issues, and suggest some initial ideas around how we as a field may attend to measurement problems that have hampered the advancement of research examining transformational leadership at more than a behavioural level. Specifically, I critically challenge (1) use of the term authentic transformational leadership, and (2) definitions of transformational leaders. It is hoped that in clarifying these misconceptions, the field may be able to advance more clearly in its collective use of language."
