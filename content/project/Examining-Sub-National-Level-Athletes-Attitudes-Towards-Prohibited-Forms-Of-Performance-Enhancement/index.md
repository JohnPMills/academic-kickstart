summary = "Doping prevalence rates in elite sport are well documented. However, little is known about athlete attitudes towards, and reported use of prohibited forms of performanceenhancement below this level. This lack of research is particularly problematic at aSub-National-level, where athletes are competing outside of tested competitions, oftenexposed to a range of new social influences, and experiencing an insecure careerenvironment. Together, these factors may do little to deter athletes from doping. Assuch, there is a need for research in this population to illuminate the antecedentcognitive processes that underpin doping attitudes, while also examining the scale ofreported use. To this end, the current study aims to examine the relationship betweenperceived career threat, potential moderating psychological mechanisms, and athlete’sattitudes towards, and reported use of, prohibited performance enhancing substancesand methods in a sample of Sub-National-level athletes."

Empirical research evidence (Whitaker, Long, Petróczi, & Backhouse, 2014; Henning& Dimeo, 2017; Pitsch & Emrich, 2011) and theoretical models (Petróczi, 2013)suggest doping within Sub-National level athletes may be more prevalent than firstthought. Doping is defined as self-reported use of one or more of the prohibitedsubstances/methods specified by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). TheSub-National-level population of athletes are characterised by three defining factors:(1) such athletes are on the precipice of a professional athletic career, (2) are aged 16to 21years, and (3) are likely to be exposed to a range of new influences (e.g., newcoaches, competitors, peers, and environments). These factors make this populationof particular interest from an anti-doping perspective. First, Sub-National level athleteson the verge of a professional career are in a high reward/low risk situation. Next, themalleability of attitude formation during this transitional life stage means they may bemore susceptible to formation of positive attitudes towards doping (Petroczi, 2013).Finally, the range of new influences they are exposed to may leave them open tosocial and environmental pressures that promote doping. As such, it is important thatresearchers attempt to identify and understand the psychosocial processes that mayaffect doping in this population.Although it is difficult to determine accurate prevalence rates, de Hon, Kuipers, andvan Bottenburg (2015) recently estimated doping prevalence to be between 14 and39% in elite-level sport. Similarly, Momaya, Fawal, and Estes (2015) suggested ratesof doping among athletes, although variable, range between 5 and 31%. Little isknown, though, regarding the prevalence of doping specifically in Sub-National-levelathletes. However, given the arguments presented previously for Sub-National-levelathletes’ susceptibility to doping, prevalence rates may be particularly high in thispopulation (Whitaker et al., 2014). As such, research examining prevalence ratestargeting this specific competitive level is warranted. The purpose of the current study, therefore, is to examine factors that may influenceSub-National-level athlete’s attitudes towards, prohibited forms of performanceenhancement in sport, as well as to determine prevalence of use in this population.Within the current study we adopt Bandura’s (1991) social cognitive theory of thoughtand action as a theoretical framework. For Bandura (1991), harmful activities, such asdoping, are deterred when a negative emotional response is anticipated (e.g., guilt).However, this anticipated response can be negated through the use of a range ofcognitive mechanisms, which restructure harmful activities so they are perceived bythe transgressor as benign or worthy (Bandura, 2010). These psychosocialmechanisms are collectively termed Moral Disengagement (MD). In this instance, MDmay facilitate doping by allowing Sub-National level athletes to use prohibited forms ofperformance enhancement without experiencing a negative emotional response. ForBandura, this process is controlled by a secondary mechanism termed self-regulatoryefficacy (SRE). SRE represents an individual’s belief in their ability to resist personaland social pressure to engage in transgressive activity. Therefore, within the currentstudy, SRE represents an individual’s capacity to withstand the influences thatencourage the use of prohibited forms of performance enhancement. Given the lowrisk/high reward environment of Sub-National level competition, Sub-National levelathletes may be particularly susceptible to doping related transgressions.In conclusion, this work is important as gaining a better understanding of the potentialinfluence of career threat on Sub-National level athletes’ attitudes towards doping, hasthe potential to inform both future research and policy interventions aimed at reducingathlete doping. Moving forward, we aim to build on the current research and test thecausal effects of perceived career threat on athletes’ attitudes towards, and use of,prohibited forms of performance enhancement. Further, we aim to developinterventions to reduce use of prohibited performance enhancers in sport. The currentstudy is a first step in this process.
