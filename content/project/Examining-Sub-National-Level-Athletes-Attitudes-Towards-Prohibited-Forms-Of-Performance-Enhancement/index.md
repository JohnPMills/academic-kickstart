Doping prevalence rates in elite sport are well documented. However, little is knownabout athlete attitudes towards, and reported use of prohibited forms of performanceenhancement below this level. This lack of research is particularly problematic at aSub-National-level, where athletes are competing outside of tested competitions, oftenexposed to a range of new social influences, and experiencing an insecure careerenvironment. Together, these factors may do little to deter athletes from doping. Assuch, there is a need for research in this population to illuminate the antecedentcognitive processes that underpin doping attitudes, while also examining the scale ofreported use. To this end, the current study aims to examine the relationship betweenperceived career threat, potential moderating psychological mechanisms, and athleteâ€™sattitudes towards, and reported use of, prohibited performance enhancing substancesand methods in a sample of Sub-National-level athletes.
