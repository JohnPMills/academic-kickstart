Moral functioning in athletes is a complex issue and dependent uponpersonal ethics and situational cues, yet research to date on dopingbehaviour has been based on narrow, binary distinctions (e.g., goodvs. bad, right vs. wrong). However, individuals are diverse in howthey define their morality. To illustrate this, consider two athletes atthe pinnacle of their sport. One uses prohibited substances, butdonates all his/her prize money to charitable organisations that seekto provide care. The second does not use prohibited substances, butdonates his/her prize money to organisations that seek to profit fromcausing harm. Which of the two athletes is morally disengaged?Some may argue that the first athlete is morally justified as throughhis/her donation, the greatest good can be maximised. Others mayview the first athlete as contravening the rules and their duty to theirfellow competitors/sport. Likewise, some may argue that the secondathlete does not contravene any rules or laws and as such, they holdthe moral superiority. In contrast, others may see such action –albeit within the rules – as morally abhorrent. A third group may beless interested in the act or outcome and more interested in thecharacter and motive of the person when evaluating the morality ofan actions. The approaches described here broadly represent threeethical theories within normative ethics: (1) Utilitarianism (i.e.,maximising good), (2) Deontology (i.e., rules, duties, or obligationsconstrain action), and (3) Virtue Ethics (i.e., personal motives andcharacter). It is likely that individuals understand their ethics using avarying balance of these different frameworks. We argue thatunderstanding personal ethics and the environment in which theyare formed may be key in developing value based anti-dopingeducation programmes. 

To achieve this aim, the current project has three main objectives. First, to explore the moral development of athletes and stakeholders, a sample of sport (e.g., team, individual) and exercise (e.g., bodybuilding, aerobics) participants (preferably athlete-parent/coach dyads) will be recruited for Moral Judgement Interviews to establish how individuals vary in their ethical frameworks. Second, these data will then be utilised to design andvalidate a novel measure of personal ethics, which not only assesses the strength of said ethics, but also provides a rank ordering of ethical priorities. Third, to develop a new value based anti-doping training programme that uses the new measure to identify thedominant personal ethic and attempts to use this information to reduce doping intentions. As such, this project will make three major contributions to anti-doping research: First, the project will advance knowledge of the potential sources of doping cognition (e.g., theinfluence of key events, environment, important others). Second, a valid and reliable measurement tool for use in anti-doping research will be developed. Third, a value based training programme based on established psychological theory that seeks to incorporate personal, behavioural and environmental factors will be developed and piloted (Bandura, 1986, 1991, 2001).
